I am.

My name is Vishal Sharma.


In my work, I build AI technologies like LLMs, rankers, retrievers, data-pipelines for (extremely) large scale data. During my PhD at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, I did research in "Generalized AI in planning, RL and Probabilistic Graphical Models" under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags">Prof. Parag Singla</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam">Prof. Mausam</a>.
