<p>I am a Ph.D. student at IIT Delhi working with <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags">Prof. Parag Singla</a>. I am interested in developing techniques that facilitate the generalization of deep neural networks trained on smaller instances of a problem to unseen larger ones.

                During my PhD, I have collaborated with <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam">Prof. Mausam</a> on learning generalized object-centric neural policies for reinforcement learning (RL) and relational planning -- policies that can be applied to an unseen variation of a given environment. This is unlike the typical RL (and planning) setting, where the policy is learned for a single environment.
                In the past, I have also worked on developing transferable lifted inference approaches for Probabilistic Graphical Models in collaboration with <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vibhav.gogate/">Prof. Vibhav Gogate</a>. I have also worked on learning object-centric video prediction models while collaborating with <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/">Prof. Guy Van den Broeck</a>.
